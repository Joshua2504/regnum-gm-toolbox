This tool was initially designed to be used by Game Masters in [Champions of Regnum](https://www.championsofregnum.com/) (formerly Regnum Online).

At this time, it allows you to use the most utilized commands for teleport and rescuing yourself in war situations. it also prevents your skillbar from resetting each time you set your level.
